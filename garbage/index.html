    Another Scam Text Message

      A text message scam that looks about right.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    This scam text message is interesting because it highlights the terrible
    security practises of many businesses. They often use domains unrelated to
    their main website. Therefore no-one can tell at a glance whether the link
    is genuinely owned/operated/used by HSBC.
  <p>
    The general way to go about these kinds of messages is to ignore any link
    or phone number in the message and to instead go directly to the
    organisation's website.
  <p>
    I think it takes far too long to report these scam messages to all the
    relevant organisations. If there was a single central place to report
    spam and scam texts, emails, and phone calls, more people would report them
    and more effective action could be taken.
  <p>
    There is a new way to report scam messages. The National Cyber Security
    Centre (NCSC) launched the
    <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/report-suspicious-emails">
      Suspicious Email Reporting Service (SERS)
    </a>
    in April 2020.
  <p>So, the latest steps to follow are:
  <ol>
    <li>forward the spam/scam text to your network operator—usually <em>7726</em>
    <li>report the spam/scam text to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/nuisance-calls-and-messages/spam-texts-and-nuisance-calls/">ICO</a>
    <li>forward the SCAM text to
      <a href="mailto:report@phishing.gov.uk">report@phishing.gov.uk</a>
  </ol>

    TNT Collection is Unsafe

  </h2>
  <p>
    A collection was arranged by Lenovo with TNT to return a laptop.
    I picked the collection date.
  <p>
    A man came in an unmarked van to pick up the package wearing a scruffy
    TNT-branded high-vis jacket.
  <p>
    There was no way to verify that the collection was legitimate other than
    praying to the fickle gods of chance.
  <p>
    Some simple things could have included:
  <ul>
    <li>telling me the name of the person doing the collection
    <li>the person telling me what was being picked up
    <li>using a pre-arranged code word
  </ul>
  <p>
    In the end, the person told me the country the shipment was heading to,
    which was better than nothing.
