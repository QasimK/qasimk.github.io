The status quo simply does not result in a good life for the majority of people in the United Kingdom. With the extent of the decline in public services over the last decade, a related question is raised: where has all the money gone?


## Governance

Above all else, a government by the people should naturally enact policies in the best interests of all the people.

- The House of Lords should be replaced by a Citizen's Assembly of rolling, randomly-selected individuals who can reject legislation with a 66% supermajority.
- The House of Commons should be elected through proportional representation or single transferable vote.
- The hereditary monarchy should be replaced with an elected individual (by anything but first-past-the-post).
- Council elections should use proportional representation.
- All elections should be held on a national holiday.
- Voter id should not be required to vote.
- All elected officials are required to declare all income, personal wealth, and favours for the five years preceding office, their time in office, and the ten years after leaving office.
- No media organisation (including social media) or owners of such should control more than 10% of the market.
- Laws preventing protests and rules discouraging protesting should be rolled back.
- Elected officials and public speakers that spread known falsehoods should be required to correct their statements with equal reach or face penalties.


## Taxation

Second, inequality in wealth leads to inequality in say.

All personal tax allowances should be replaced with Universal Basic Income paid to all adults.

Income, National Insurance, Dividend, and Capital Gains taxes should be combined into a single Lifetime Income tax, with Employer's National Insurance scrapped entirely.

Stamp Duty, Council tax, Business Rates and Capital Gains tax on property should be replaced by a Land Value tax paid by landowners.

All tax avoidance schemes for wealthy individuals and transnational corporations should be closed, including severing agreements with tax havens and taxing non-domiciled residents.
- All land and companies must declare their beneficial owners.


## Education

Thirdly, education is the path to a better future.

- Public schools should have their charitable status removed and VAT should be charged on fees.
- State schools should be fully funded to reach parity with public school funding levels.
- Reduce class sizes to a maximum of 20 children.
- Tuition fees for undergraduates should be scrapped, with all existing student loan debt written off.
- All adults should have the same opportunity to attend university as schoolchildren if they have not already.
- Social care should fully funded with more powers to deal with disciplinary problems within schools and at home with parents.


## Childcare

All children from the age of one should have access to free play-based schooling.

Maternity and paternity leave should be combined into one-year of shared parental leave at 80% pay funded by the government.



## Energy

- All tax breaks and subsidies for fossil fuel companies should end.
- A tax on all carbon-based imports including fuel and manufactured products should be introduced.
- No carbon offset and carbon capture and storage schemes should be funded by the government.


## Transport

- All public transport should be free for children and the elderly, and subsidised for everyone else.
- All urban and suburban homes should have access to a train or bus network with regular service within a 15-minute walk.
- Public transport should be expanded to provide access to national parks.
- All new and resurfaced roads should have zebra crossings continuous with the pavement, dedicated cycle lanes, and priority lanes for buses.
- All pavements should be encouraged to include trees and use plants as natural barriers.
- Vehicles should be taxed by size, weight, air and noise pollution.
- Electric bicycles and scooters should be allowed on all public transport.
- A frequent flyer charge should be introduced for anyone who flies more than once a year.


## Housing

All homes should have access to groceries, pharmacies, doctors, primary schools, public transport, and parks within a 30-minute walk.

All newly-built homes should be carbon-neutral, without a gas supply, use a mechanical ventilation system, provide secure external cycle storage and, if parking is included, electrical car chargers.

A national housebuilding project should provide at-cost social housing to all who request it.

- The right to buy scheme should be ended.

A new tenants rights taskforce to investigate complaints and order landlords to immediately fix mold, leaks, broken appliances.

All landlords should be responsible for gradually upgrading their properties to a carbon-neutral standard by 2050, or face ongoing penalties.
- All help-to-buy financial schemes should be ended.


## Healthcare

NHS to be fully funded and all agreements with private healthcare providers should be ended.

NHS should expand to eye care, dentistry, and social care including at-home care.

Air pollution should be tackled to meet international guidelines.


## Work and Training

- The minimum hourly wage should be increased to 60% of the median hourly pay, with some adjustment for age.
- Apprenticeships should fully funded by the government as an alternative route to college and university education.
- All adults should have free access to apprenticeships, training courses, and adult learning centres.
- Sick leave should be paid at 100% of salary from day one.


## Environment

Water companies should stop dumping untreated sewerage, and they should be prevented from paying dividends until water leak targets are met.

All advertising for food, drinks, gambling, cigarettes, vaping, and fossil fuel companies should be banned in all areas of life.

Noise pollution targets should be set. These can be tackled through reducing noise from vehicles, appliances, and improving sound insulation.

Light pollution targets should be set.


## Bugbears

There's a bunch of little things that really bug me but may not have a significant impact.

- Lorries blearing "warning vehicle is turning left" or loudly beeping
- Extremely bright or badly-aligned headlamps on some new vehicles
- Absurdly loud cars, quadbikes and motorbikes in quiet residential areas
- Bright white street lamps
