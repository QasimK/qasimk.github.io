# Could a Universal Basic Income work?

A universal basic income would guarantee a basic standard of living to all individuals. It would be a social safety net without restrictions or the overhead of complex bureaucracy.

Could it actually work in the UK?

The most insidious factor would be individuals who rent from private landlords. There is no bigger drain on a nation that rent-seekers.

## How much do we spend now? (2021-22)

It was surprisingly difficult to find this information.

Pension
Pension Credit
Pension Housing Benefit
Winter Fuel Payment
Total Pension: £116 billion

Disability Living Allowance
Personal Independence Allowance
Attendance Allowance
Total Disability Benefits - £26 billion

Child Benefit - £11.4 billion

Old Housing Benefit - unemployed, low income, claiming benefits
Old income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
Old income-related Employment and Support Allowance
Old Working Tax Credit
Universal Credit (18-66, <£16000 savings)
Total Benefits: £77.6 billion

There are 67.5 million people. 19% < 16, 19% > 65.

Pensioner Average: £116 billion / 12.8 million = £9000/pensioner/year (£173/week)
Child Average: £11.4 billion / 12.8 million = £890/child/year (£17/week)

## What would an alternative look like?

We can scrap pensions, universal credit, and child benefit
Total: £205 billion.

£205 billion / 67.5 million = £3000/person/year

That's £57/week.

For a universal basic income that's barely good enough. Pensions would need a top-up for sure. Working age adults would need to supplement their income.

It would just need to be complemented by a free nationwide zero-carbon council housing programme available to anyone who requests a home, no restrictions.

It doesn't really make any sense that depending on how lucky you were with which family you were born into, you would have no home to live your adult life in except to pay rent to a landlord. z

For each birthday from the 13th, the child would get an additional 20% of the UBI directly.
